**Project Title: Implementation of a Scalable and Secure Campus Network**

**Objective:**
Design a scalable and secure campus network using RIP for routing, VLANs for segmentation, and Telnet, SSH, and DHCP for management.

**Key Components:**

1. **Routing:**
   - **RIP Protocol:** Ensures efficient data routing between main and branch campuses.

2. **Segmentation:**
   - **VLANs:** Isolate traffic for improved performance and security.

3. **Remote Management:**
   - **Telnet:** Remote access for internal network management.
   - **SSH:** Secure, encrypted remote management.

4. **IP Address Management:**
   - **DHCP:** Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Design Topology:** Create a detailed network diagram.
2. **Configure RIP:** Set up RIP on routers for routing updates.
3. **Set Up VLANs:** Configure VLANs on switches and implement trunking.
4. **Enable Telnet & SSH:** Configure devices for remote management.
5. **Deploy DHCP:** Set up a DHCP server for dynamic IP assignment.
